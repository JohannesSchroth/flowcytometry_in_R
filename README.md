# flowcytometry_in_R

Script for standard analysis of FACS data, later to be included in more generic functions.
Stared on 16-October-2018.

User Input Section:
Directories specify locations of raw data, gating template, and saving locations of plots created.
Idea is for this section to be the only place the user has to specify their variables, from which point onwards the  script will run automatically.
